## This GitHub Actions workflow runs SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini with select environments,
## whenever a GitHub pull request is opened or synchronized in a repository
## where GitHub Actions are enabled.
##
## It builds and checks some sage spkgs as defined in TARGETS.
##
## A job succeeds if there is no error.
##
## The build is run with "make V=0", so the build logs of individual packages are suppressed.
##
## At the end, all package build logs that contain an error are printed out.
##
## After all jobs have finished (or are canceled) and a short delay,
## tar files of all logs are made available as "build artifacts".
