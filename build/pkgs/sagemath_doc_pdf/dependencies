# Building the documentation has many dependencies, because all
# documented modules are imported and because we use matplotlib to
# produce plots.
#
# If not going through wheels, sagemath_doc_html has to be an order-only
# dependency to avoid concurrency bugs because both sagemath_doc_html
# and sagemath_doc_pdf may modify the doctrees and inventories.
