# Disable features that require packages SCIP and CoCoA, both of which
# are experimental packages.

# FLINT is a standard package and E-ANTIC is an optional package.  We
# pass --with-flint and --with-e-antic to configure so
# that an error will be signalled if FLINT or E-ANTIC cannot be found, rather
# than building normaliz without it.

# Temporarily removed until e-antic is fixed:  --with-e-antic
